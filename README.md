# CNN-Layer-Visualization
Using the Chars74k Dataset to train a VGG style CNN for classification and visualizing the feature maps created by every layer.
A VGG style CNN is trained on the dataset and the feature maps are analysed for the convolutional layers to see what the layers evolve to detect.

From the feature maps generated by the later convolution and maxpool layers, we can see that unlike the earlier layers these are capturing deeper hierarchical features which are not as intelligible as the lower level features. Initial layers seem to be focussed on capturing the boundaries of the character being passed through whereas the later features seem to be learning abstractions over the same.
